# Notes on making a violin.

Below diagram of the mould is based on many online sources. It is based on some of my calcualtions, it's not correct and not tested.

The bridge should be directly centred on the notches of the f-holes (florentines). If notches are uneven, the left notch takes priority.

Moving this upper base side out 0.5mm will make the instrument more strident and brilliant and sparkling. Anything over 1mm and it will sound like fingernails on the chalkboard.

Moving the upper treble side out makes the instrument more flute-like. If you 
go too far it will sound like a cardboard box.

Moving this lower bout out 0.5mm, the voice of the instrument will become more cavernous.
1-1.5mm voice will become hollow, and the tone will have no core, it won’t travel through the concert hall.

The narrower waist will give you a quicker response while a wider one will offer more power.

The wider and deeper the flame the mellower and deeper the sound the maple is what gives a master violin its deep power or its masculine voice.

Form is 4.5mm shorter and narrower than the violin

Sound post should be Xmm from the treble foot of the bridge where X is the thickness of the belly where bridge is located.
If your top-plate thickness is less than 3/16i1'usethe measur�nient of your
thickness to determine where the post will be. I think that it can be accepted as a
rule·of thumb, that whatever the thickness of the top� that "dll be the distance the
posVwill be back from the bridge. 

Ribs - 1mm
Lining 2mm by 5mm
